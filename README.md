# MillitextEncoder

A while back, I came across the idea of [millitext](http://www.msarnoff.org/millitext/), where text is encoded using the coloured subpixels that make up an individual pixel on a screen.

Unfortunately, the [generator](http://www.msarnoff.org/millitextgen/) that's also on that website doesn't work anymore, so I was inspired to make my own version.

My version uses a 2-pixel width for each character and uses a font that I designed that can display all printable ASCII characters (control characters are just boxes), including lowercase. I might make a version that includes larger character sizes that look nicer or uses an extended ASCII character set later.
